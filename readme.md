# Right Click Fix for Mac OS X

This is an extension for Chrome on Mac OS X. The Mac version of Chrome will, by default, auto select text when you right click on it. This is very annoying for Web Developers who often right click on text in order to use the Dev Tools inspection functionality. 

This extension uses a pretty simple script that will detect when you right click and prevent the text from being auto-selected. 

Note: This extension is for Chrome on Mac OS X only. It will not do anything for Chrome on other operating systems.
